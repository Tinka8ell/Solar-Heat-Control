# SolarHeatControl
Raspberry Pi controller for lo-tech swimming pool solar heating support.

As well as controlling the use of the Solar heated (or not) supply, it also off-loads status data to UBIDOTS, 
where it also gets control instructions.

The controller as well as maintaining a desktop GUI status, controls a cut down display for a local LCD panel.

As internet access can be intermittent, it attempts to use the internet, but maintains a log and control information locally.
